# -Image-Classification-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-on-CIFAR-10-Dataset-

**Overview**
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into 10 categories using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging data augmentation techniques to enhance generalization. The project demonstrates essential deep learning concepts in image classification and computer vision.

**The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images categorized into the following classes:**
Airplane
Automobile
Bird
Cat
Deer
Dog
Frog
Horse
Ship
Truck
Features

1.Data Augmentation: Applied transformations like rotation, horizontal flip, and zoom to increase model robustness.
2.CNN Architecture: Implemented Convolutional layers with ReLU activation, followed by MaxPooling and Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
3.Loss and Optimization: Used Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy as the loss function and Adam optimizer for efficient training.
4.Evaluation Metrics: Model performance evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix.
5.Visualization: Training and validation accuracy/loss graphs, along with confusion matrix visualization, are included.

Model Architecture
The implemented CNN model consists of the following layers:

**Input Layer: Accepts 32x32x3 RGB images.**

1.Convolutional Layers: Extracts image features using multiple Conv2D layers with ReLU activation.
2.MaxPooling Layers: Reduces spatial dimensions while retaining important features.
3.Dropout Layers: Applied to prevent overfitting by randomly setting neurons to zero.
4.Fully Connected Layers: Flattens the output and connects to Dense layers for classification.
5.Output Layer: Uses Softmax activation for multi-class classification into 10 categories.

**Results**
Achieved high accuracy on the test set with effective image classification across all categories.
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score metrics were calculated for detailed performance evaluation.
Confusion Matrix and accuracy/loss graphs are provided for visualization.

**Usage**
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as learning rate and batch size, to optimize performance.
Use the model to make predictions on custom images by providing the image path.

**Visualization**
Training and Validation Accuracy/Loss Graphs: Track model performance over epochs.
Confusion Matrix: Visualizes true vs. predicted labels for detailed analysis.
